                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>We are looking to add books to our schedule for next year! To accomplish this, our coordinator has established a 2-step process to make the decision a democratic process among our members.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step 1: </strong> Club members will submit up to 3 books to the list for consideration before the deadline using the “Submit a Book” page. You are welcome to provide a URL to the book and a description of the book (or the first paragraph). Once the deadline has passed, you'll go back into the app and proceed to Step 2.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO SUBMIT A BOOK:</strong> For each book you'd like to submit, you will need at a minimum the Title, Author, and Description of the book.  You will also have an optional space to provide the URL of the book.  For the description, you can either write your own description, copy a review from a bookseller website, provide the first paragraph of the book, or write why you want to read this book.  Each book submission is designed to take no more than 1 minute to complete.
                    
                    
                    <p><strong>Step 2: </strong> Head to the “Submit your Vote” page before the vote deadline, review the list of books, and rank your top 5 books.  Books with a lower number will be ranked higher and weighted accordingly.</p>
                    
                    <p>After the voting deadline has passed, our coordinator will send around the Top 12 books.  Our coordinator will send around a meeting schedule shortly after the Top 12 list has been sent around.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    Don't feel like using this app? Feel free to contact as at SFBookClubHelp@SFBC.org and we can help with submitting your book recommendations and your vote by email.   </p>
